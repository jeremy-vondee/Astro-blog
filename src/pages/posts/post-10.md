Building locally is fun, but I really wanted to share my blog with others.

I followed a simple deployment flow:

1. Created a Git repository for my project.
2. Pushed it to a hosting provider that supports Astro.
3. Set up automatic deployments from the main branch.

Seeing my site live on the web felt like a huge milestone.
