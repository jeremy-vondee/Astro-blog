Once I had content and structure, it was time to make my blog look better.

I started by adding some basic styles:

- A readable font stack.
- Comfortable line height for paragraphs.
- Decent spacing between sections and headings.

## Small changes, big impact

I didn’t do anything fancy. No animations, no gradients, no dark mode—yet.

But even simple changes like:

- Increasing `line-height` for paragraphs.
- Adding margins above and below headings.
- Setting a max width for the main content.

made the blog much easier to read. It’s a reminder that **good typography is a feature**.
