Once I had a few posts, scrolling through direct URLs wasn’t fun anymore.

So I built a blog index page that lists all my posts with:

- Their titles.
- Publication dates.
- Links to full articles.

It made the blog feel more complete, and it gave me a natural place to send people who want to explore my writing.
