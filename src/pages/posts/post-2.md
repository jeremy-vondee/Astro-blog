After a successful first week learning Astro, I decided to keep going and see how much further I could push my little blog.

This time, I wanted to understand **how components really work**, how layouts keep things consistent, and how far I could get without adding any heavy JavaScript frameworks. It felt a bit scary at first, but also exciting—like unlocking a new level in a game.

## Revisiting what I learned

Before jumping into new features, I went back over what I had already built:

1. I reviewed my first blog post and checked how the frontmatter connects to the layout.
2. I confirmed how Astro uses file-based routing to turn Markdown files into real pages.
3. I cleaned up a few little styling issues, especially spacing and headings.

Just doing this made the whole project feel more **intentional** instead of something I was randomly hacking together.

## Building a small component from memory

My main goal for this session was to write and import a small Astro component entirely from memory, without copying from the docs.

I decided to create a simple `Badge` component that I could reuse to show tags or labels in different places on the site. This helped me practice:

- Creating a new file in `src/components`.
- Using `Astro.props` to accept text and style variants.
- Importing and using that component inside a blog post layout.

Even though the component itself was tiny, writing it from memory made Astro feel much more natural.

## Experimenting with styling

Once the component worked, I started playing with styles:

- I tweaked my header and navigation to look better on small screens.
- I adjusted font sizes and line heights for more comfortable reading.
- I tested how my pages looked on both desktop and mobile viewports.

Each small change made the site feel more like a **real blog** and less like a tutorial example.

## What I want to do next

Now that I’ve built a second post and a custom component, I’m starting to see how powerful Astro is for content-focused sites.

Next on my list:

- Add more posts and group them by tag or topic.
- Improve the layout for my blog index page.
- Experiment with an interactive component using an island (maybe a theme switcher or a small counter).
