I love dark mode, so I decided to experiment with it on my Astro blog.

I didn’t build a full theme switcher yet, but I started defining:

- Color variables for light and dark themes.
- A basic toggle stored in local storage.
- Styles that respect the user’s system preference.

It isn’t perfect yet, but even this small experiment made the site feel more modern.
