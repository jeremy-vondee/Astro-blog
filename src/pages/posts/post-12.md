I started adding tags to my posts right in the frontmatter.

Tags like `astro`, `blogging`, and `learning in public` help me identify patterns in what I write about and make it easier to group related posts in the future.

It’s a simple concept, but it opens up a lot of possibilities: tag pages, filters, and curated reading lists.
