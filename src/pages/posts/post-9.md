I wanted my Astro blog to be usable by more people, so I took a closer look at accessibility.

Some of the changes I made:

- Checked color contrast for text on my background.
- Added `aria-label`s where necessary.
- Ensured headings appear in a logical order.

The code barely changed, but the experience improved. It’s a good reminder that accessibility is not optional—it’s part of doing the job well.
